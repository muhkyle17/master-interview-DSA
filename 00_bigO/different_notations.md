Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations are used to describe the rate of growth of a function. Big O notation is used to describe an upper bound on the growth rate of a function. It describes the maximum amount of time or space that an algorithm will take to complete, given a worst-case scenario. Big Omega notation is used to describe a lower bound on the growth rate of a function. It describes the minimum amount of time or space that an algorithm will take to complete, given a best-case scenario. Big Theta notation is used to describe both an upper and lower bound on the growth rate of a function. It describes the exact amount of time or space that an algorithm will take to complete, given an average scenario. In other words, Big O notation gives an upper bound on the growth, Big Omega gives a lower bound, and Big Theta gives both upper and lower bounds.
